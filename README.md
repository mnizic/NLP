The project was developed for the master's thesis titled "Automated Categorization of Scientific Papers in the Field of Social Science." It involves the conversion of text file containing titles, abstracts, and categories of Web of Science articles into a CSV file. Following this, the program undertakes the preprocessing and classification of the data. The program also offers the flexibility of manual data input for which the model tries to give its prediction. Additionally, the project provides visualizations of the results and showcases some of the algorithm's predictions, culminating in informative outputs.
